                <p>At Topcasi.com, we pride ourselves on delivering your orders quickly and reliably. Here’s a detailed look at our delivery policies:</p>

                <p class="modal__p">1. Order Processing</p>
                <p>Once you place your order, we get to work right away. Processing typically takes between 3 to 15 business days, depending on order volume and any current promotions. We’ll keep you updated every step of the way.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">2. Shipping Timelines and Procedures</p>
                <p>Shipping times vary by product and are clearly indicated on each product page, ensuring you have an accurate estimate of when your order will arrive.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">3. Warranty Coverage</p>
                <p>Should you find a defect covered by our warranty, reach out to our support team within the warranty period and provide your receipt. We’ll assess the product to determine if it qualifies for coverage.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">4. Handling Warranty Claims</p>
                <p>For valid warranty claims, we will either repair or replace the product at our discretion. If the original item is unavailable, we’ll substitute it with one of equal or greater value. The warranty period of the original purchase applies to all repairs or replacements.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">5. Exceptions to Warranty</p>
                <p>Our warranty does not cover:</p>
                <ul style="color: #000; text-align: left;">
                    <li>Normal wear and tear</li>
                    <li>Damage due to misuse, accidental or intentional</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized modifications or repairs</li>
                    <li>Failure to follow maintenance instructions</li>
                    <li>External events like accidents or natural disasters</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="modal__p">6. Confirming Orders</p>
                <p>To prevent any delays, please ensure your shipping details are accurate. Double-check all information during checkout.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">7. Returns Process</p>
                <p>If your shipment is returned due to incorrect contact information or if you’re unavailable to receive it, we’ll get in touch to arrange another delivery. This may involve additional fees.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">8. Shipping Restrictions</p>
                <p>Certain products may have shipping restrictions based on their nature or destination. We’ll notify you of any restrictions and suggest alternatives if necessary.</p>
