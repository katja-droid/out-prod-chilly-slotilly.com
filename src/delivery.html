                <p>Welcome to Best5Online.com! We take pride in ensuring your gifts are delivered swiftly and securely. Here’s everything you need to know about our shipping policies:</p>

                <p class="modal__p">1. Order Processing Time</p>
                <p>After placing your order, we start processing it immediately. Processing typically takes 3 to 15 business days, depending on current order volumes and any ongoing promotions. We’ll keep you informed throughout the process.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">2. Shipping Times and Procedures</p>
                <p>Shipping times vary by product and are clearly indicated on each product page, providing you with an accurate estimate of when your order will arrive.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">3. Warranty Policy</p>
                <p>If you encounter any defects covered by our warranty, contact our support team within the warranty period and provide your receipt. We’ll assess the product to determine if it qualifies for warranty coverage.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">4. Handling Warranty Claims</p>
                <p>For valid warranty claims, we will repair or replace the product at our discretion. If the original item is unavailable, we’ll substitute it with one of equal or greater value. The original purchase's warranty period applies to all repairs or replacements.</p>

                <p>Our warranty does not cover:</p>

                    <li>Normal wear and tear</li>
                    <li>Damage due to misuse, accidental or intentional</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized modifications or repairs</li>

                    <li>External events like accidents or natural disasters</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="modal__p">6. Order Confirmation</p>
                <p>To avoid delays, please ensure your shipping details are accurate. Double-check all information during checkout.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">7. Return Process</p>
                <p>If your shipment is returned due to incorrect contact information or if you’re unavailable to receive it, we’ll contact you to arrange another delivery. This may involve additional fees.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">8. Shipping Restrictions</p>
                <p>Some products may have shipping restrictions based on their nature or destination. We’ll notify you of any restrictions and suggest alternatives if necessary.</p>
