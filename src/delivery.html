Welcome to Aviatoras, where safeguarding your privacy is as crucial as charting your next adventure. Below, we outline our steadfast commitment to protecting your data and the meticulous protocols governing its handling when you engage with our services and website.

    </p>

    <p class="modal__p">1. Flight Plan Initiation:</p>
    <p>Once your order embarks on its journey, we swiftly initiate the shipping process. Depending on the volume of orders and ongoing promotions, this journey typically spans between 3 to 15 business days.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      2. Tailored Timelines and Routes::
    </p>
    <p>Each product on our runway boasts its own flight path, clearly outlined on the product page or packaging, ensuring you receive a personalized estimate for your delivery.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      3. Warranty Cloud Cover:
    </p>
    <p>Encountered a hiccup covered by our warranty? Alert our support tower within the warranty period, presenting your purchase receipt. We'll scrutinize the product to ascertain if it glides under our warranty umbrella.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      4. Navigating Warranty Claims:
    </p>
    <p>Valid warranty claims are handled with the precision of a seasoned pilot. Through repair or replacement, at our discretion, we ensure smooth skies ahead. If the original product is grounded, we may seamlessly substitute it with an item of equal or greater value, maintaining the warranty duration from the original purchase.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">5. Warranty Turbulences:</p>
    <p>
    Exceptions to our warranty may include the natural turbulence of wear and tear, damage from unexpected nosedives (accidental or intentional), unauthorized tweaks or repairs, failure to heed provided maintenance instructions, and incidents originating from external factors like unexpected gusts or natural calamities.
    </p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      6. Destination Confirmation:
    </p>
    <p>Ensure your shipping coordinates are precise before takeoff. Verify all details during checkout to avoid any detours.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      7. Return Voyage Procedures:
    </p>
    <p>If a shipment circles back due to inaccurate coordinates or your unavailability for receipt, our ground control will reach out to arrange a successful touchdown. Additional fees may apply for this re-entry.</p>

    <p class="modal__p">
      8. Navigational Constraints:
    </p>
    <p>Certain products may have restricted flight paths based on their characteristics or destination. We'll alert you to any such constraints and offer alternate routes if needed.</p>

    <p>For further inquiries or flight assistance regarding our delivery policies, please reach out to our customer support team at info@aviatoras.com. We're dedicated to ensuring your orders soar with precision and promptness, guiding your adventures to new heights.</p>
