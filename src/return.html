            At BigBass, we prioritize your complete satisfaction with every purchase. We've established straightforward return guidelines to make your experience smooth and hassle-free. Here’s what you need to know to initiate a return:
        </p>

        <p class="modal__p">1. Return Conditions:</p>
        <p>Products must be returned in their original, unused condition, complete with original tags and packaging. Custom or personalized items are eligible for returns only if they have defects or were received in a damaged state.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            2. Return Period:
        </p>
        <p>You have 14 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return. Contact our customer support team as soon as possible to begin this process.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            3. Steps to Return:
        </p>
        <p>Start by emailing our customer support for a return authorization code. Pack the item securely in its original box, including all the accessories and documentation that came with the product, and label it with the provided authorization code. Send it back using a traceable mail service. The cost of return shipping is the responsibility of the customer, except in cases of our error.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            4. Refunds and Exchanges:
        </p>
        <p>Once we receive your returned item and it passes inspection, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and typically take 5-7 business days to process. Exchanges are subject to product availability. If an item is not available, we may offer a replacement or a refund instead. Note that original shipping fees are non-refundable unless the return is due to a mistake on our part.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            5. Handling Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>If you receive an item that is damaged or incorrect, please contact our customer service immediately with photographs and a detailed account of the issue. We will handle return shipping costs for such items and provide a refund or replacement as needed.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            6. Dealing with Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>Certain items, like swimwear, are not returnable for hygiene reasons. Please refer to specific product pages for more detailed information or contact customer support for clarification.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            7. Return Policy Exceptions:
        </p>
        <p>Purchases made from third-party sellers or external platforms are not eligible for returns through BigBass. Please review the seller’s return policy before purchasing.</p>

        <p>If you have questions or need further assistance with your return, please don’t hesitate to contact our support team at support@BigBass.com. At BigBass, we're committed to providing you with superior service and ensuring your shopping experience is nothing short of excellent.</p>
