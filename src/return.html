                <p class="modal__p">At Topcasi, we prioritize your satisfaction and aim to make your shopping experience as smooth as possible. Below are our guidelines for initiating a return:</p>

                <p class="modal__p">1. Return Conditions:</p>
                <p>Items must be returned in their original, unused condition, with all tags and packaging intact. Customized products can only be returned if they arrive defective or damaged.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">2. Return Period:</p>
                <p>You have 24 days from the delivery date to start a return. Please contact our customer support team promptly to begin the process.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">3. Steps to Return:</p>
                <p><strong>Request Authorization:</strong> Email our customer support to request a return authorization code.</p>
                <p><strong>Prepare Your Package:</strong> Securely pack the item in its original box, including all accessories and documentation. Affix the provided authorization code.</p>
                <p><strong>Ship the Item:</strong> Use a traceable mail service for return shipping. Customers are responsible for return shipping costs, except in cases where we made an error.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">4. Refunds and Exchanges:</p>
                <p>Once we receive and verify the condition of your returned item, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method and typically take 5-7 business days to reflect. Exchanges are subject to product availability. If an item is unavailable, we may offer a replacement or refund. Please note that original shipping fees are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">5. Handling Damaged or Incorrect Items:</p>
                <p>If you receive a damaged or incorrect item, contact our customer service team immediately with photographs and details. We will cover return shipping costs for such items and provide a refund or replacement as needed.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">6. Non-Returnable Items:</p>
                <p>Certain items, such as hygiene-sensitive products like swimwear, are non-returnable for sanitary reasons. Please refer to specific product pages for details or reach out to our customer support for clarification.</p>

                <p class="modal__p">7. Return Policy Exceptions:</p>
                <p>Items purchased from third-party sellers or external platforms are not eligible for returns through Topcasi.com. Please review the sellerâ€™s return policy before making a purchase.</p>

                <p>For any further inquiries or assistance with your return, feel free to contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@Topcasi.com">support@Topcasi.com</a>. At Topcasi, we're dedicated to providing exceptional service and ensuring your satisfaction with every purchase.</p>
