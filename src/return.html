        </p>

        <p class="modal__p">1. Return Conditions:</p>
        <p>Products must be returned in their original, unused condition, with all tags and packaging intact. Customized items can be returned only if they are defective or damaged upon receipt.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            2. Return Period:
        </p>
        <p>You have 24 days from the delivery date to initiate a return. Please contact our customer support promptly to initiate the process.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            3. Steps to Return:
        </p>
        <p>Begin by emailing our customer support to request a return authorization code. Securely pack the item in its original box, including all accessories and documentation, and affix the provided authorization code. Use a traceable mail service for return shipping. Customers are responsible for return shipping costs, except in cases of our error.
</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            4. Refunds and Exchanges:
        </p>
        <p>Upon receiving your returned item and verifying its condition, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and typically take 5-7 business days to reflect. Exchanges are subject to product availability. If an item is unavailable, we may offer a replacement or refund. Please note that original shipping fees are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            5. Handling Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>If you receive a damaged or incorrect item, contact our customer service immediately with photographs and details. We will cover return shipping costs for such items and provide a refund or replacement as necessary.</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            6. Dealing with Damaged or Incorrect Items:
        </p>
        <p>Certain items, such as hygiene-sensitive products like swimwear, are non-returnable for sanitary reasons. Please refer to specific product pages for details or reach out to our customer support for clarification.

</p>

        <p class="modal__p">
            7. Return Policy Exceptions:
        </p>
